## Hello there 👋
Information Security enthusiast fascinated by automation and its impact on people both inside and outside the workplace.

I grew up building Bionicles, always eagar to build them and resist following the manual. I wanted to create the end result based on the picture that was displayed, without instructions. This eagerness to solve problems and create solutions during the early days of the internet led me to the world of Information Technology. Naturally, like many other IT professionals, I have grown to greatly dislike printers.
